# Laptop-Price-Predictor
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate the price of laptops based on various features like brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size, and more. This tool is useful for consumers, retailers, and market analysts who want to predict laptop prices or compare the value of different models.

Key Features
Feature Extraction:
Extracts important features from the dataset, such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage type, screen size, and more.
Data Preprocessing: 
Cleans and prepares the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model Training:
Trains multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict laptop prices based on input features.
Model Evaluation: 
Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to select the best-performing model.
Price Prediction:
Provides an easy-to-use interface for predicting laptop prices by entering specific features.
Deployment:
Can be easily deployed as a web app using Flask  for real-time predictions.
